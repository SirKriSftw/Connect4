# Connect4
This is a simple terminal game of connect 4. To run it yourself just make sure you have ruby installed (if you need to install: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
Once installed just go to the Connect4 directory and run ruby lib/main.rb

There are 4 options for playing
  - Clear terminal after wins
  - Clear terminal after turns
  - Go Against AI
  - AI v AI
To set each param just go to main.rb file and change the play function call, setting true to what you want enabled (same order as the list above)


Here is what it looks like:
