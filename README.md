# Connect4
This is a simple terminal game of connect 4. To run it yourself just make sure you have ruby installed (if you need to install: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
Once installed just go to the Connect4 directory and run ruby lib/main.rb

By default the terminal window will clear after every match. If you want to disable that just edit the main.rb file where it says "board.play(true, false)" and switch the true to false.
The second parameter is if you want the terminal to clear after every turn, simply just swap the false to true and you will have that effect!


Here is what it looks like:
