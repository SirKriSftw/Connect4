# Connect4
This is a simple terminal game of connect 4. To run it yourself just make sure you have ruby installed (if you need to install: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
Once installed just go to the Connect4 directory and run ruby lib/main.rb

There are 4 options asked whenever you start a new game:
  - Would you like to clear the terminal after every match?
  - Would you like to clear the terminal after every turn?
  - Would you like to face an AI?
  - Would you like two AIs to go against each other?
If you just press enter for all options, only play against AI will set to true by default. Otherwise you Y and N to choose to enable/disable option
After a match you can choose to play again with same options or choose to not play again and change options

If the 7x6 board is not to your liking you can go into the board.rb file and change the HEIGHT and WIDTH constants to your liking! Enjoy ☻♥
